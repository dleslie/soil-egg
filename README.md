# soil

[[toc:]]

[SOIL](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) bindings for Chicken.

The source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dleslie/soil-egg)

The interface adheres closely to the stock SOIL interface.

soil is known to work on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, and with OpenGL ES. soil will automatically compile with ES support on ARM hardware, or when `gles` is defined during compilation (e.g. `chicken-install -D gles`).

Much thanks to Jonathan Dummer for writing the original SOIL library.

## SOIL Overview

[SOIL](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) is a tiny C library for uploading images as textures into OpenGL. Also, saving and loading of images is supported.

SOIL uses [Sean's Tool Box](http://www.nothings.org/) image loader as a base, upgrading it to load TGA and DDS files, and adds a direct path for loading DDS files straight into OpenGL textures, when applicable.

The following image formats are supported:

- BMP: load and save
- TGA: load and save
- DDS: load and save
- PNG: load
- JPG: load

OpenGL Texture Features:

- resample to power-of-two sizes
- MIPmap generation
- compressed texture S3TC formats (if supported)
- can pre-multiply alpha for you, for better compositing
- can flip image about the y-axis (except pre-compressed DDS files)

### Flags

#### Image Loading

These flags affect the format of images that are loaded.

    [constant] force-channels/auto

Leaves the image in whatever format it was found.

    [constant] force-channels/luminous

Forces the image to load as Luminous (greyscale).

    [constant] force-channels/luminous-alpha

Forces the image to load as Luminous with Alpha.

    [constant] force-channels/rgb

Forces the image to load as Red Green Blue.

    [constant] force-channels/rgba

Forces the image to load as Red Green Blue Alpha.

#### Texture Creation

    [constant] texture-id/create-new-id

Passed in as the `texture-id` argument, this will cause soil to register a new texture ID using `gl:gen-textures`. If the value passed as a `texture-id` argument is greater than zero, then soil will just reuse that texture ID (great for reloading image assets in-game).

#### OpenGL Texture Format
If multiple `texture/***` flags are to be passed to the `texture` argument, they must be OR’d (i.e. with `bitwise-ior`) together.

    [constant] texture/power-of-two

Force the image to be power-of-two.

    [constant] texture/mipmaps

Generate mipmaps for the texture.

    [constant] texture/repeats

Sets the image to repeating, otherwise it will be clamped.

    [constant] texture/multiply-alpha

For when using (`gl:+one+`, `gl:+one-minus-src-alpha+`) blending.

    [constant] texture/invert-y

Flip the image vertically.

    [constant] texture/compress

If the card supports it this will convert RGB to DXT1, and RGBA to DXT5.

    [constant] texture/dds-direct

Will load DDS files directly without any additional processing.

    [constant] texture/ntsc-safe-rgb

Clamps RGB components to the NTSC GL safe range.

    [constant] texture/cogo-y

RGB becomes CoYCg and RGBA becomes CoCgAY.

    [constant] texture/rectangle

Uses `ARB_texture_rectangle`; generates pixedl indexed with no repeat, mip maps or cube maps.

#### Saving File Formats

    [constant] save-type/tga

TGA format in uncompressed RGBA or RGB.

    [constant] save-type/bmp

BMP format in uncompressed RGB

    [constant] save-type/dds

DDS format in DXT1 or DXT5

#### Internal HDR Representations

    [constant] fake-hdr/rgbe

RGB * pow( 2.0, A - 128.0)

    [constant] fake-hdr/rgb-div-alpha

RGB / A

    [constant] fake-hdr/rgb-div-alpha-squared

RGB / (A * A)
